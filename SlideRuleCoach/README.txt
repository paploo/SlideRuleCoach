Overview:

A simple iPhone application to generate problems to practice using a slide rule.

Todo List:
[ ] Add License test to all files.

[ ] Build out Problem Generators:
    [ ] Basic:
        [ ] Multiplication (a*b*c)
        [ ] Inversion (1/a)
        [ ] Fractions (a*c*e/b*d*f)
        [ ] Ratio-proportions
    [ ] Squares, Cubes and Roots:
        [ ] Squares (b^2)
        [ ] Cubes (b^3)
        [ ] Roots (sqrt(b), croot(b))
        [ ] A-B Scales Squares (a*b^2)
    [ ] Powers and Logs:
        [ ] log10(x)
        [ ] 10^x
        [ ] logn(x)
        [ ] x^n
    [ ] Trig:
        [ ] x degrees in radians
        [ ] x radians in degrees
        [ ] sin(x), x in [5.7392, 90]
        [ ] cos(x), x in [0, 84.2608]
        [ ] tan(x), x in [5.7106, 89.4270]  Note: Should break at 45 as well?
        [ ] sin(x), x in [0.5730, 5.27392]
        [ ] cos(x), x in [84.2608, 89.4270] Note: Most rules aren't marked for this?
        [ ] tan(x), x in [0.5729, 5.7106]
    [ ] Special:
        [ ] Hyperbolic Trig functions?
        [ ] Artillary Ranging.

[ ] Build exams

[ ] Break exam list into sections

[ ] Help button for problems

[ ] Selecting exam gives info about exam.

[ ] Difficulties:
    [ ] Make generators use difficulty.
    [ ] Add screen on test start to set difficulty.

[ ] Notepad:
    [ ] Add a problem note-pad area where you can see the problem and can make notes about the answer.
